Abstract
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, materials 
science, and biology. Analyzing Raman spectra and identifying the presence of specific substances within a sample can be a 
complex task due to the large available database. The Raman Match application was developed to simplify the sample identification 
process. The application integrates the well-established RRUFF Raman database with the python programming language and provides 
a user-friendly graphical interface for loading Raman spectra, identifying peaks, matching peaks to reference libraries, 
visualizing the results, and produce publication ready figures.
